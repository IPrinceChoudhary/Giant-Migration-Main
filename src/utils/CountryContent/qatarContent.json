      "question": "Can expatriates in Qatar migrate to Canada or Australia?",

Your Gulf work experience is valuable, especially in fields like engineering, healthcare, IT, oil & gas, construction, and finance.

      "question": "How is Gulf work experience evaluated for immigration?",
      "answer": "Canadian and Australian immigration authorities recognize and value Gulf work experience.

For Australia, similar documentation plus payslips and contracts. Gulf salaries are often higher which demonstrates your skill level. However, employment letters must be detailed and verifiable. We help Gulf-based professionals prepare proper documentation that meets immigration requirements.",
